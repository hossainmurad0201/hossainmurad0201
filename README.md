## Overview

This project implements an **image classification model** using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The goal of this repository is to provide a robust framework for training, testing, and deploying deep learning models to classify images from the **[CIFAR-10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)** dataset.

### Key Features:

- **CNN architecture**: Implements a deep Convolutional Neural Network to classify images into 10 categories.
- **Custom Training Pipeline**: Includes data preprocessing, data augmentation, and configurable training steps.
- **Transfer Learning**: Utilizes pre-trained models (ResNet, VGG) for better accuracy.
- **Deployment**: Instructions for deploying the model with Docker for scalable and cloud-based solutions.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) or [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) (both frameworks supported)
- Jupyter Notebook (for experimenting)
- Docker (for deployment)

To install the necessary dependencies, follow these steps:


# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/username/ai-image-classification.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd ai-image-classification

# Create a virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Usage
-**Running the Pre-trained Model
Once the environment is set up, you can use the pre-trained model to classify images:

"python predict.py --input data/sample_image.png"

You can also experiment with different test cases by modifying the sample image.

# Experimenting with Jupyter Notebooks
 Use the Jupyter Notebooks provided to run and explore the project:


"jupyter notebook notebooks/Image_Classification.ipynb "

Inside the notebook, you can view data visualizations, train models, and evaluate performance metrics.

# Model Training
You can train your own models on the CIFAR-10 dataset (or other datasets) by following these steps:

-**Place your training dataset in the data/ directory.
-**Modify the training configuration in config.yaml as needed (e.g., batch size, epochs, learning rate).

"python train.py --config config.yaml"

After training, the model checkpoints will be saved in the checkpoints/ directory, and the training logs will be saved in the logs/ directory.

Pre-trained Models
Pre-trained models are available for quick deployment. These models were trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset and can be used for inference or further fine-tuning:

Model 1: Simple CNN architecture with ~80% accuracy on CIFAR-10. Download
Model 2: ResNet-50 Transfer Learning model with ~90% accuracy on CIFAR-10. Download
Deployment
You can deploy the trained models using Docker for production use. The Dockerfile provided in the repository allows for containerized deployment.

bash
Copy code
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t ai-image-classification .

# Run the Docker container
docker run -p 5000:5000 ai-image-classification
You can now send image classification requests to the model service via http://localhost:5000/predict.

API Usage
The deployed service exposes an API for predicting the class of an image. You can use curl or any HTTP client to make a request:

bash
Copy code
curl -X POST -F 'image=@path_to_your_image' http://localhost:5000/predict
The API will return a JSON response with the predicted class and the confidence score.
